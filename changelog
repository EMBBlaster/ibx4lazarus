IBX Change Log  version 1.0-1-  Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:43:00 +0100

1. In IBCustomDataset. Fixed weak typing i.e. changed CurBookmark from string to TBookmark.
   Necessary because of TBookmark type change in fpc 2.7.1

2. IBX now registers TIntegerField as a "No Icon" component. This may be removed if the fpc DB
   package is changed to do this (which it should do).

1. Add "if active then active := false" to TIBCustomDataset destructor. (Avoid error on database close).

2. Make use of $STATIC conditional in IBSQLMonitor (Needed for FPC 2.6.0 compliance)

3. Database Property Editor: Character Set drop down box now uses "OnChange" rather than "OnCloseUp" to react to changes

4. Property editors should now correctly resize.

5. In IBDatabaseEdit.TestClick, the LoginPrompt is now set to the state of the LoginPrompt Checkbox
   (restored original functionality)

6. Under OSX, if IBX fails to load libfbclient.dylib, it will now try and load the firebird
   library using the absolute path /Library/Frameworks/Firebird.framework/Firebird.
