IBX Change Log  version      (1.3-0) Tue, 14 Jul 2015 16:32:40 +0100

1.   OnCloseUp Event Handler added to TDBLookupProperties

2.   IBDynamicGrid: Call to OnEditorPanelHide is now last editor hide action - avoids
     problem with row size when exception is called.

3.   IBLookupComboEditBox: Force pending autocomplete on combobox exit.

4.   IBDynamicGrid and DBControlGrid: Keyhandler now ignores up, down, escape and return keys if
     in a TCustomComboBox and ignores return key if in a TCustomMemo

5.   IBLookupComboEditBox: Ensure that KeyValue is set correctly when full text
     keyed in i.e. when autocomplete not performed

6.   Cleanup of "Uses" clauses and console mode support. IBX should now support
     console mode applications with all LCL required functions centralised in the
     IBDialogs unit. As long as "IBDialogs" is not included in your project, IBX
     should compile and link with a console mode program. See consolemode example
     for further guidence. DO NOT add the ibexpress package to a console mode
     application or the IDE will automatically assume that you application is
     GUI based. Instead, you should include the ibexpressconsolemode package.

     IMPORTANT NOTE: IBDialogs must be included in GUI applications in order 
     to use the built in dialogs and cursor management. IBDialogs is
     included by default if "ibexpress" is in your project source "uses" clause.
     This should be the case for all projects created through the IDE. This is why
     you do not want to add the ibexpress package to console mode applications. The
     ibexpressconsolemode package has been created to allow console mode programs
     to avoid adding LCL dependencies when using IBX, while still having the
     unit search paths set up correctly.

     You may find that in order for the IDE to recognise that ibexpressconsolemode
     exists, you have to first open the package in the IDE and then close it. This
     adds it to the most recently accessed packages list. To make it permanently
     available, add the package name to lazarus' staticpackages.inc file.

     Under Windows, the TISQLMonitor OnSQL Event Handler may require a new call to
	 Application.ProcessMessages in order to display an event journal correctly. See
	 example. This was previously called by TISQLMonitor itself but removed to avoid
	 a GUI dependency.

	 Thansk to Julio Jim√©nez for suggesting support of console mode.

7.   SQL Parser can now accept quoted strings that include new lines

8.   IBDynamicGrid: Lookup Cell Editor - the cursor is now positioned at end 
     of text on start of edit. This is particularly useful when tabbing to a
     column and then inserting text.

9.   New Examples provided for IB Services and ISQLMonitor.

10. Fix error when writing to blob streams that recorded only the last buffer
    write in the blob stream. In most cases, this did not cause a problem as the
    IB Blob Stream is written in a single write. However, with the TDBImage, write
    of a graphic type prefix was lost which caused a problem when the image could
	not be automatically recognised.

11. Improve generation of random cursor names in TIBSQL - avoid risk of "cursor
    already open" errors due to random numbers being identical.

12. IBTable: corrected error that could result in an "Index out of bounds" error
    when opening the table and the Primary Key is the last or only column in the
    table. Thanks to Rick Hoover for the fix.

13. Fix TIBDatabase initialisation of lc_ctype under unix. Set to "UTF8" instead
    of "UTF-8", and update list of available database character sets. Existing
    users should check the current lc_ctype setting in their applications.

IBX Change Log  version                                                              (1.2-4) Sat, 09 May 2015 12:38:29 +0100

1.  Firebird Services: avoid List Index error when opening a service with an
    empty Params property.

2.  IBControls: Fix problem with new link mechanism introduced in 1.2.3.
    Link now set up in Loaded method - avoids occasional failure to apply
    SQL markup on initial open.

3.  "Employees" example performance improvements when scrolling.

4.  DBControlGrid: Correctly handle edit panel removal when panel is child control of a
    TFrame. Force recaching of selected frame to avoid GTK race (results in a
    random image cached).

5.  DBControlGrid: Should now react to changes in panel height at run time.

6.  IBDynamicGrid: Redraws rows below on panel editor hide - avoids blank space at end of grid   
    even when further rows exist.

7.  DBControlGrid: DefaultRowHeight is no longer a published property as it should
    always be derived from panel height and setting this property can cause confusion.
    Note for existing projects: to avoid a missing property error at run time,
    each form using the DBControlGrid must be opened, updated and saved in the IDE
    in order to remove the property value from the lfm.


IBX Change Log  version                                                          (1.2-3) Tue, 14 Apr 2015 14:11:17 +0100

1.  TIBStoredProc. Prepare now called by ParamByName to avoid need to always
    call Prepare before setting parameter values.

2.  Error message on ParamByName (all cases) not found now includes name of missing parameter.

3.  Code tidyup and more robust handling of dsql information result vector.

4.  Support for centralised handling of transaction status changes. TIBTransaction
    has been given additional events "AfterEdit", "AfterInsert", "AfterDelete", "AfterPost"
    and "AfterExecQuery". The first three are called after the same event is called
    for an IBCustomDataSet descendent using the Transaction. The fourth is called
    after a call to TIBSQL.ExecQuery, again using this transaction. These new events
    enable monitoring of transaction status changes for a given transaction to be
    handled in a single place. For example, when a change to the dataset occurs
    an indicator can be set that shows the user that in order to save changes,
    the transaction should be committed.  Rather than doing this per dataset, this
    can now be done per transaction.

5.  TDataSet.CheckBrowseMode automatically posts changes to the current row when
    the dataset is scrolled. However, any changes to the current row are, by default,
    discarded when the dataset is closed. TIBDataSet, TIBQuery and TIBTable now
    have a new property "DataSetCloseAction" that adds automatic posting of changes
    on dataset close. If this property is set to dcDiscardChanges (default) then the
    behaviour is unchanged from previous versions. if the value is set to dcSaveChanges
    then IBX will attempt to post any unsaved changes before the dataset is closed
    (and after the BeforeClose event handler is called). The exception is when the
    dataset is being closed as a result of a transaction rollback. In this case,
    no action is taken and any unsaved  changes are discarded. This avoids both
    unnecessary overhead and the risk that a validation error may occur in the Post
    raising an exception and thereby preventing a rollback.

6.  String Field sizes and Display Widths should now be correct for multi-byte character sets.
    In earlier versions, the Display Width was set to the maximum byte width rather than the character
    width. Display Widths are now corrected by dividing by the max byte width per character.
    For UTF8 character sets, the byte width is four and hence the Display Width will be
    the byte width divided by 4. The byte width of each character set is determined
    dynamically when the database connection is estabished from the RDB$CHARACTER_SETS
    system table. (see also http://bugs.freepascal.org/view.php?id=27766).

7.  SQLParser will now correctly parse SQL Text which contains ':' within quoted string.

8.  IBLookupComboEditBox: List should now always be restored to full list when the
    control loses focus. Default Key press default interval reduced to 200ms.

9.  DBControlGrid: Ensure that selection is changed to newly appended row, even
    when dataset rows are less than visible rows.

10. IBDynamicGrid: Editor Panel is not shown on indicator click if Datasource
    does not exist or DataSet is empty. More responsive on dataset open. New event
    OnRestorePosition. Column sort disabled if no header row.

11. IBTreeView: improved handling of response to "Add Node". Avoid scrolling dataset
    while dataset state is dsInsert. Avoids posting errors.

12. IBControls: New mechanism for distributing UpdateSQL and UpdateParams events. This is to
    avoid conflict with DisableControls/EnableControls with Master/Detail linked tables.

13. IBLookupComboEditBox: Now avoids SQL Errors when combo box text contains single quotes.

14. TIBDataSet and TIBQuery: new Event - OnValidatePost. This event has been introduced
    to solve a specific problem. That is when the dataset cursor is moved (e.g. by
    a grid mouse click and the current row is being edited or inserted. In this case, TDataset
    always "posts" the current record regardless or whether or not it may be more appropriate
    to cancel any changes; the post occurs before the "BeforeScroll" event fires due to the way the
    "MoveBy" function is implemented by TDataSet. The OnValidatePost event is called
    as the first action of the "Post" method and allows the handler to convert the Post
    into a Cancel if that is the appropriate action on moving to a different row. This is
    achieved by returning with "CancelPost" argument set to true. Note that an exception could be
    raised here, but it may still be more appropriate to validate a post and signal
    a problem in the "BeforePost" event handler. See readme.automaticposts.xhtml)

15. On Unix derived systems, the Firebird library name can now be given as a colon
    separated list. Each library name on the list is tried in turn, in left to right
    order with the first found being used as the firebird library. By default, on Linux,
    the library name list is 'libfbembed.so.2.5:libfbembed.so.2.1:libfbclient.so.2'. This can be
    overidden by the FBLIB environment variable or the OnGetLibraryName function.

    Note: when using the libfbembed.so, if you prefix the database name with "localhost:"
    then it will still attempt to access the database via the Firebird Server and will
    require a username and password. If only the pathname is given, then the username
    and password should be omitted and the unix file permissions are used to grant
    access.

IBX Change Log  version                                                    (1.2-2) Sat, 14 Mar 2015 11:35:04 +0000

1.  A new IBControl - TDBControlGrid has been added. TDBControlGrid a lookalike 
    rather than a clone for the Delphi TDBCrtlGrid. TDBControlGrid is a single column grid 
    that replicates a TWinControl - typically a TPanel or a TFrame in each row. Each row 
    corresponds to a row of the linked DataSource. Any data aware control on the 
    replicated (e.g.) TPanel will then appear to have the appropriate value for the row.

2. As suggested by Julio Jim√©nez, a new property "SQLHourGlass" has been added to TIBDatabase.
   When set to false (default true), the Hour Glass cursor is supcpressed and no cursor change
   takes place during database access. This may be useful when there are performance issues with
   the change of cursor. Setting the property to false suppresses the change of cursor.

3. As suggested by Julio Jim√©nez, a new property "AutoCommit" has been added to TIBDataSet, TIBQuery
   and TIBTable. When set to acCommitRetaining (Default: acDisabled), a call is made to 
   Transaction.CommitRetaining immediately after every Post or Delete. This has the effect of
   making all changes permanent immediately rather than when the transaction is explicitly 
   committed.

4. Experimental support for the Firebird 3 SQL_BOOLEAN type has been added while still
   using the legacy Firebird API. Thanks to Gabor Boros for helping to test this feature.

IBX Change Log  version                                                   (1.2-1) Fri, 13 Mar 2015 11:14:15 +0000

Development version only.

IBX Change Log  version                                      (1.2-0) Thu, 26 Feb 2015 10:34:04 +0000

1. An internal select SQL Parser is now available for TIBCustomDataset descendents.
   This is typically used during an "OnBeforeOpen" event handler to manipulate the
   "Where" and "Having" clauses to implement user specified filters of arbitrary
   complexity.

2. A new Component Palette entry "Firebird Data Controls" is now available. This has
   three new data aware controls dependent on IBX and which make use of the SQL Parser.
   These are:

   - TIBLookupComboEditBox
   - TIBDynamicGrid
   - TIBTreeview

   TIBLookupComboEditBox is a TDBLookupComboBox descendent that implements "autocomplete"
   of typed in text and "autoinsert" of new entries. Autocomplete uses SQL manipulation
   to revise the available list and restrict it to items that are prefixed by the
   typed text (either case sensitive or case insensitive). Autoinsert allows a
   newly typed entry to be added to the list dataset and included in the available
   list items.

   TIBDynamicGrid is a TDBGrid descendent that provides for:
   - automatic resizing of selected columns to fill the available row length
   - automatic positioning and sizing of a "totals" control, typically at the
     column footer, on a per column basis.
   - DataSet resorting on header row click, sorting the dataset by the selected column.
     A second click on the same header cell reversed the sort order.
   - Support for a "Panel Editor". That is on clicking the indicator column, the row
     is automatically expanded and a panel superimposed on it. The panel can have any
     number of child controls, typically data aware controls with the same datasource
     as the grid allowing for editing of additional fields and more complex editors.
   - Reselection of the same row following resorting.
   - A new cell editor that provides the same functionality as TIBLookupComboEditBox.
     Its properties are specified on a per column basis and allows for one or more
     columns to have their values selected from a list provided by a dataset.
     Autocomplete and autoinsert are also available. The existing picklist editor
     is unaffected by the extension.

   TIBTreeView is a data aware TCustomTreeView.

3. When getting a field value using FieldByName.AsVariant, an SQL_INT64 with a
   zero scale will no longer return an error. An Int64 will be returned instead.

4. TIBTransaction now has events for Before and After Transaction End and a new function
   "GetEndAction" allowing the EndAction to be accessed by these event handlers.

5. TIBQuery can now handle correctly queries which contain the same keyword parameter 
   repeated multiple times.

6. TIBUpdateSQL will no longer return an error when "RowsAffected" is <> 1. This error
   check used to get in the way of using Stored Procedures, and "Update or Insert"
   statements.

7. Insert, Modify and Delete property Editors now support Query Generation from
   Stored Procedures.

8. Three new examples illustrate the use of the new IB Controls


IBX Change Log  version                      (1.1-0) Mon, 07 Jul 2014 14:01:07 +0100

1. TIBXSQLVAR code clean up and optimisation to improve client side "prepare" and parameter
   setting performance. See "readme.field+param.names in the doc folder.(Thanks to
   Gabor Boros for reporting this problem and for testing the improvements).

2. IBX can now support dialect 3 quoted column names that contain spaces and which differ only in their case.
   See readme.field+param.names in the doc folder.

3. IBX SQL Editors will now automatically add double quotes around column names when the database
   dialect is "3" and the column name contains spaces or is a Firebird 2.5 SQL Reserved Word.

4. Param Type LargeInt now supported in TIBQuery and TIBStoredProc

5. TIBSQL.ExecQuery retry on failure removed to avoid problems with "at most once"
   actions.

6. TIBTransaction.SetDefaultDatabase uses SetObjectProp instead of mis-using SetOrdProp (with
   thanks to Yuriy Kopnin for pointing this out).

7. GenerateParamName is now a published property of TIBSQL, TIBQuery and TIBDataSet.

8. varWord, varShortInt and varInt64 added to TIBXSQLVAR.SetAsVariant and hence now available as variant types
   for both fields and parameter setting.

9. Changes to the Select SQL in an IBCustomDataset descendent should now be
   visible in the Fields Editor immediately afterwards - rather than only after cycling the "active" property.

10. TIBSQL SQL editor will operate correctly and not report an SQL syntax error on SQL test,
    when DSQL ('?') parameter placeholders are used and the TIBSQL.GenerateParamNames property is set to true.

11. TIBTable now has a property editor for "MasterFields"

12. SQL Property Editors now include a checkbox "Allow DSQL Placeholder". This corresponds to the
    GenerateParamNames property and should be set when using DSQL (i.e. '?') style parameters.

13. The IBTransaction editor now has a radio button ("Unspecified") which is set when the combination
    of settings is unrecognised. Selecting this radio button has no effect on the settings.
   

IBX Change Log  version                 (1.0-5) Sat, 28 Dec 2013 19:22:23 +0000

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to >= 2.7.0 to match revised availability of change.

IBX Change Log  version          (1.0-4) Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:56:13 +0000

1. In a TIBCustomDataset descendent, a generator now only sets the value when
   it is null. This allows for alternative user defined setting of the generator

   Many thanks to Julio Jim√©nez for this fix

2. An Error Dialog is now displayed in the Lazarus IDE if IBX cannot find the Firebird Library
   and suggests that the user may have forgotten to install it.

IBX Change Log  version         (1.0-3) Thu, 22 Nov 2012 22:53:39 +0000

1. Conditional compilation used to limit registration of TIntegerField to
   Lazarus versions less than 1.1

2. When a database connection is created, character set is now by default set
   to UTF8 (Unix) or to the current Windows code page (Windows) if in the range
   1250 to 1254.


IBX Change Log  version     (1.0-2) Tue, 09 Oct 2012 09:10:30 +0100

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to > 2.6.2 to match expected availability of change.


IBX Change Log  version    (1.0-1) Sun, 05 Aug 2012 20:00:04 +0100

1. In IBCustomDataset. Changed CurBookmark from string to TBookmark for compiler versions > 2.6.0
   Necessary because of TBookmark type and TDataSet.Bookmark property change in fpc 2.7.1

2. IBX now registers TIntegerField as a "No Icon" component. This may be removed if the fpc DB
   package is changed to do this (which it should do).

IBX Change Log  version (1.0-0)  Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:43:00 +0100

1. Add "if active then active := false" to TIBCustomDataset destructor. (Avoid error on database close).

2. Make use of $STATIC conditional in IBSQLMonitor (Needed for FPC 2.6.0 compliance)

3. Database Property Editor: Character Set drop down box now uses "OnChange" rather than "OnCloseUp" to react to changes

4. Property editors should now correctly resize.

5. In IBDatabaseEdit.TestClick, the LoginPrompt is now set to the state of the LoginPrompt Checkbox
   (restored original functionality)

6. Under OSX, if IBX fails to load libfbclient.dylib, it will now try and load the firebird
   library using the absolute path /Library/Frameworks/Firebird.framework/Firebird.
