IBX Change Log  version                         (1.2-0) Wed, 25 Feb 2015 12:13:20 +0000

1. An internal select SQL Parser is now available for TIBCustomDataset descendents.
   This is typically used during an "OnBeforeOpen" event handler to manipulate the
   "Where" and "Having" clauses to implement user specified filters of arbitrary
   complexity.

2. A new Component Palette entry "Firebird Data Controls" is now available. This has
   three new data aware controls dependent on IBX and which make use of the SQL Parser.
   These are:

   - TIBLookupComboEditBox
   - TIBDynamicGrid
   - TIBTreeview

   TIBLookupComboEditBox is a TDBLookupComboBox descendent that implements "autocomplete"
   of typed in text and "autoinsert" of new entries. Autocomplete uses SQL manipulation
   to revise the available list and restrict it to items that are prefixed by the
   typed text (either case sensitive or case insenstive). Autoinsert allows a
   newly typed entry to be added to the list dataset and included in the available
   list items.

   TIBDynamicGrid is a TDBGrid descendent that provides for:
   - automatic resizing of selected columns to fill the available row length
   - automatic positioning and sizing of a "totals" control, typically at the
     column footer, on a per column basis.
   - DataSet resorting on header row click, sorting the dataset by the selected column.
     A second click on the same header cell reversed the sort order.
   - Support for a "Panel Editor". That is on clicking the indicator column, the row
     is automatically expanded and a panel superimposed on it. The panel can have any
     number of child controls, typically data aware controls with the same datasource
     as the grid allowing for editing of additional fields and more complex editors.
   - Reselection of the same row following resorting.
   - A new cell editor that provides the same functionality as TIBLookupComboEditBox.
     Its properties are specified on a per column basis and allows for one or more
     columns to have their values selected from a list provided by a dataset.
     Autocomplete and autoinsert are also available. The existing picklist editor
     is unaffected by the extension.

   TIBTreeView is a data aware TCustomTreeView.

3. When getting a field value using FieldByName.AsVariant, an SQL_INT64 with a
   zero scale will no longer return an error. An Int64 will be returned instead.

4. TIBTransaction now has events for Before and After Transaction End and a new function
   "GetEndAction" allowing the EndAction to be accessed by these event handlers.

5. TIBQuery can now handle correctly queries which contain the same keyword parameter 
   repeated multiple times.

6. TIBUpdateSQL will no longer return an error when "RowsAffected" is <> 1. This error
   check used to get in the way of using Stored Procedures, and "Update or Insert"
   statements.

7. Insert, Modify and Delete property Editors now support Query Generation from
   Stored Procedures.

8. Three new examples illustrate the use of the new IB Controls


IBX Change Log  version                      (1.1-0) Mon, 07 Jul 2014 14:01:07 +0100

1. TIBXSQLVAR code clean up and optimisation to improve client side "prepare" and parameter
   setting performance. See "readme.field+param.names in the doc folder.(Thanks to
   Gabor Boros for reporting this problem and for testing the improvements).

2. IBX can now support dialect 3 quoted column names that contain spaces and which differ only in their case.
   See readme.field+param.names in the doc folder.

3. IBX SQL Editors will now automatically add double quotes around column names when the database
   dialect is "3" and the column name contains spaces or is a Firebird 2.5 SQL Reserved Word.

4. Param Type LargeInt now supported in TIBQuery and TIBStoredProc

5. TIBSQL.ExecQuery retry on failure removed to avoid problems with "at most once"
   actions.

6. TIBTransaction.SetDefaultDatabase uses SetObjectProp instead of mis-using SetOrdProp (with
   thanks to Yuriy Kopnin for pointing this out).

7. GenerateParamName is now a published property of TIBSQL, TIBQuery and TIBDataSet.

8. varWord, varShortInt and varInt64 added to TIBXSQLVAR.SetAsVariant and hence now available as variant types
   for both fields and parameter setting.

9. Changes to the Select SQL in an IBCustomDataset descendent should now be
   visible in the Fields Editor immediately afterwards - rather than only after cycling the "active" property.

10. TIBSQL SQL editor will operate correctly and not report an SQL syntax error on SQL test,
    when DSQL ('?') parameter placeholders are used and the TIBSQL.GenerateParamNames property is set to true.

11. TIBTable now has a property editor for "MasterFields"

12. SQL Property Editors now include a checkbox "Allow DSQL Placeholder". This corresponds to the
    GenerateParamNames property and should be set when using DSQL (i.e. '?') style parameters.

13. The IBTransaction editor now has a radio button ("Unspecified") which is set when the combination
    of settings is unrecognised. Selecting this radio button has no effect on the settings.
   

IBX Change Log  version                 (1.0-5) Sat, 28 Dec 2013 19:22:23 +0000

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to >= 2.7.0 to match revised availability of change.

IBX Change Log  version          (1.0-4) Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:56:13 +0000

1. In a TIBCustomDataset descendent, a generator now only sets the value when
   it is null. This allows for alternative user defined setting of the generator

   Many thanks to Julio JimÃ©nez for this fix

2. An Error Dialog is now displayed in the Lazarus IDE if IBX cannot find the Firebird Library
   and suggests that the user may have forgotten to install it.

IBX Change Log  version         (1.0-3) Thu, 22 Nov 2012 22:53:39 +0000

1. Conditional compilation used to limit registration of TIntegerField to
   Lazarus versions less than 1.1

2. When a database connection is created, character set is now by default set
   to UTF8 (Unix) or to the current Windows code page (Windows) if in the range
   1250 to 1254.


IBX Change Log  version     (1.0-2) Tue, 09 Oct 2012 09:10:30 +0100

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to > 2.6.2 to match expected availability of change.


IBX Change Log  version    (1.0-1) Sun, 05 Aug 2012 20:00:04 +0100

1. In IBCustomDataset. Changed CurBookmark from string to TBookmark for compiler versions > 2.6.0
   Necessary because of TBookmark type and TDataSet.Bookmark property change in fpc 2.7.1

2. IBX now registers TIntegerField as a "No Icon" component. This may be removed if the fpc DB
   package is changed to do this (which it should do).

IBX Change Log  version (1.0-0)  Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:43:00 +0100

1. Add "if active then active := false" to TIBCustomDataset destructor. (Avoid error on database close).

2. Make use of $STATIC conditional in IBSQLMonitor (Needed for FPC 2.6.0 compliance)

3. Database Property Editor: Character Set drop down box now uses "OnChange" rather than "OnCloseUp" to react to changes

4. Property editors should now correctly resize.

5. In IBDatabaseEdit.TestClick, the LoginPrompt is now set to the state of the LoginPrompt Checkbox
   (restored original functionality)

6. Under OSX, if IBX fails to load libfbclient.dylib, it will now try and load the firebird
   library using the absolute path /Library/Frameworks/Firebird.framework/Firebird.
