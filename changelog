IBX Change Log  version                  (1.1-0) tba, 26 Jun 2014 16:51:37 +0100

1. Param Type LargeInt now supported in TIBQuery and TIBStoredProc

2. TIBSQL.ExecQuery retry on failure removed to avoid problems with "at most once"
   actions.

3. TIBTransaction.SetDefaultDatabase uses SetObjectProp instead of mis-using SetOrdProp (with
   thanks to Yuriy Kopnin for pointing this out).

4. TIBXSQLVAR code clean up and optimisation to improve client side "prepare" and parameter
   setting performance. See "readme.clientside.performance in the doc folder.(Thanks to
   Gabor Boros for reporting this problem and for testing the improvements).

5. GenerateParamName is now a published property of TIBSQL

6. varWord, varShortInt and varInt64 added to TIBXSQLVAR.SetAsVariant and hence now available as variant types
   for both fields and parameter setting.

7. Changes to the Select SQL in an IBCustomDataset descendent should now be
   visible in the Fields Editor immediately afterwards - rather than only after cycling the "active" property.

8. IBX can now support dialect 3 quoted column names that contain spaces and which differ only in their case. 
   See readme.field+param.names in the doc folder.

9. IBX SQL Editors will now automatically add double quotes when the database dialect is "3" and the column name 
   contains spaces or is a Firebird 2.5 SQL Reserved Word.

10. TIBSQL SQL editor will operate correctly and not report an SQL syntax error on SQL test, 
    when DSQL ('?') parameter placeholders are used and the TIBSQL.GenerateParamNames property is set to true.

11. TTable now has a property editor for "MasterFields"
   

IBX Change Log  version                 (1.0-5) Sat, 28 Dec 2013 19:22:23 +0000

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to >= 2.7.0 to match revised availability of change.

IBX Change Log  version          (1.0-4) Thu, 28 Feb 2013 16:56:13 +0000

1. In a TIBCustomDataset descendent, a generator now only sets the value when
   it is null. This allows for alternative user defined setting of the generator

   Many thanks to Julio JimÃ©nez for this fix

2. An Error Dialog is now displayed in the Lazarus IDE if IBX cannot find the Firebird Library
   and suggests that the user may have forgotten to install it.

IBX Change Log  version         (1.0-3) Thu, 22 Nov 2012 22:53:39 +0000

1. Conditional compilation used to limit registration of TIntegerField to
   Lazarus versions less than 1.1

2. When a database connection is created, character set is now by default set
   to UTF8 (Unix) or to the current Windows code page (Windows) if in the range
   1250 to 1254.


IBX Change Log  version     (1.0-2) Tue, 09 Oct 2012 09:10:30 +0100

1. TBookmark change conditional compile changed to > 2.6.2 to match expected availability of change.


IBX Change Log  version    (1.0-1) Sun, 05 Aug 2012 20:00:04 +0100

1. In IBCustomDataset. Changed CurBookmark from string to TBookmark for compiler versions > 2.6.0
   Necessary because of TBookmark type and TDataSet.Bookmark property change in fpc 2.7.1

2. IBX now registers TIntegerField as a "No Icon" component. This may be removed if the fpc DB
   package is changed to do this (which it should do).

IBX Change Log  version (1.0-0)  Sat, 28 Apr 2012 16:43:00 +0100

1. Add "if active then active := false" to TIBCustomDataset destructor. (Avoid error on database close).

2. Make use of $STATIC conditional in IBSQLMonitor (Needed for FPC 2.6.0 compliance)

3. Database Property Editor: Character Set drop down box now uses "OnChange" rather than "OnCloseUp" to react to changes

4. Property editors should now correctly resize.

5. In IBDatabaseEdit.TestClick, the LoginPrompt is now set to the state of the LoginPrompt Checkbox
   (restored original functionality)

6. Under OSX, if IBX fails to load libfbclient.dylib, it will now try and load the firebird
   library using the absolute path /Library/Frameworks/Firebird.framework/Firebird.
