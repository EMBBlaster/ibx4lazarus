# IBX for Lazarus

IBX for Lazarus is derived from the Open Source edition of IBX published by Borland/Inprise in 
2000 under the InterBase Public License. This version has been brought up-to-date by MWA Software
(http://www.mwasoftware.co.uk) and focuses on the Firebird Database API for both Linux and Windows
platforms. It is released under the InterBase Public License for the original code and under the
compatible Initial Developers Public License for new software.

See the "doc" directory for more information and installation instructions.

See the "changelog" for information on changes from previous releases

Note 1. The MWA Software packages "fbintf" (https://github.com/MWASoftware/fbintf) and 
        "ibcontrols" (https://github.com/MWASoftware/ibcontrols) are required dependencies and 
        must be installed before IBX for Lazarus is itself installed.

Note 2. The Firebird RDBMS (https://www.firebirdsql.org/) is also required and again should
        be installed before IBX for Lazarus. Before running any IBX examples, the Firebird example
        "employee database" must also be installed and enabled, if not installed by default 
        when Firebird is installed.
